            <div>
              <p>
                My name is Assaad Ghabi, and I‚Äôm a Full Stack .NET and Angular Developer with 8 years of experience. I graduated from the National Engineering School of Monastir in 2017.

            <h6>üè¢ Taysir Solutions</h6>
            <div>
              <p>
                I began my career at Taysir Solutions, a company specialized in developing IT solutions across various sectors including healthcare, finance, and services.
              </p>
              <p>
                I had the opportunity to work on three major projects:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>AddInvoice</strong> : a billing system for the finance sector.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>DMI</strong> : a medical records management application.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Ticketing</strong> : a service-oriented ticket management platform built from scratch.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p>
                The Ticketing project was particularly significant for me, as I took on a managerial role in addition to development.<br/>
I supervised a team of 6 developers, handled internal training, contributed to team skill development, and was actively involved in weekly Agile Scrum sprints.

          <article id="diginov">
            <h6>üè¢ Diginov</h6>
            <div>
              <p>
                Later, I joined Diginov, where I worked on two platforms developed from scratch for the Ministry of Economy of the United Arab Emirates:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>UAE SME</strong> : a portal giving SMEs access to government programs, business advisory services, and funding opportunities.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>FGIC</strong> : a GIS-based system used to visualize nationwide economic data via interactive maps.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                In this role, I was involved in business analysis, requirements documentation, and full-stack development using ASP.NET Core and SQL Server, within one-week Agile sprints.

            <div>
              <p>
                Since 2021, I‚Äôve been part of Capgemini Engineering, contributing to the development of digital tools for Volkswagen, specifically on projects like {" "}
                <strong>AskMe</strong>, <strong>TV</strong> et{" "}
                <strong>PPRobEE</strong>.
              </p>
              <p>
These tools are used by car service workshops to manage :
                <br />
                estimates, scheduling, operations, inspections, and more.
              </p>
              <p>
                My role covers both back-end (.NET Core, Worker Services) and front-end (Angular) development. I‚Äôm also involved in : Supporting team members, Onboarding new joiners, Writing unit tests, Conducting code reviews
              </p>
              <p>
                We follow the Agile Scrum methodology rigorously, with 2-week sprints and all standard ceremonies (daily stand-ups, sprint planning, reviews, and retrospectives) in a fully English-speaking, international environment.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since April 2025, I have also taken on the role of Functional Owner for SEAT (Volkswagen Group), where I‚Äôm responsible for : Business analysis, Writing and refining user stories, Backlog prioritization with the Product Owner, Functional validation of deliverables.
              </p>
              <p>This position allows me to combine technical expertise with a strong functional and product-oriented dimension.</p>

                That‚Äôs a quick overview of my background.<br/>
                I hope my presentation was clear, and I‚Äôd be happy to answer any questions you might have.

            <h6>Why do you want to leave Capgemini ?</h6>
            <div>
              <p>
                I'm grateful for everything I've learned at Capgemini <br/> the projects were enriching and allowed me to grow both technically and functionally.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, in recent months, the workload has become quite heavy, leaving little room for continuous learning or technical improvement.
              </p>
              <p>
                I‚Äôm now looking for an environment that‚Äôs better structured and more balanced <br/> one that values both productivity and long-term growth.
