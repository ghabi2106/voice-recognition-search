                I am a full-stack developer with over 8 years of experience
                specializing in .NET and Angular. <br />I graduated as an
                engineer from the University of Monastir, Tunisia, in 2017.{" "}
                <br />
                My expertise spans diverse sectors, including automotive,
                healthcare, GIS, and entrepreneurship. <br />
                Currently, I am working at Capgemini. <br />I have extensive
                experience in software architecture, design, development,
                testing, and deployment, with a strong background in Agile
                methodology.
              </p>
              <p>
                I currently work at Capgemini with Volkswagen as the client,
                where I have been for three years. <br />I contribute to
                multiple projects, including TV, AskMe, and PPRobEE. <br />
                These automotive management solutions help small to mid-sized
                auto shops with tasks such as estimating, scheduling,
                inspections, job tracking, and reporting. <br />I worked on the
                full lifecycle of these applications, covering requirements
                analysis, design, development, testing, deployment, and
                maintenance. <br />
                The team, using Agile methodology, developed the apps with .NET
                Core 5, Angular 13, and SQL Server.
